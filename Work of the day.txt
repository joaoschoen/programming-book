WORK OF THE DAY:

While I'm done with the major part of the history of computing I decided to work on it a little bit more

I'm also going to read my own example that I created to explain the problems in the real world and how to look at them like a programmer does

I'm also thinking of starting to add some picture into the book because I feel it's a too much of a text wall

Will probably finish the chapters about history and the basics of programming logic today
