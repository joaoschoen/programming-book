# Diary

I thought it'd be fun to add here my thoughts and decisions while writing the book to keep some sort of a story of how this book was written.

I'm starting this after having chapters 1 through 3 written already, but these 3 are already a retroactive addition to my book because this wasn't going to be a book at the start, it was going to be just a document for me to organize the results of my research in and categorize the many technologies, libraries, frameworks and applications used in web dev.

This diary also allows to write in a less strict manner then I write in the book, because there I'm trying to follow a logical sequence of building up knowledge, so here I can write stuff out of order.

The more I try to go forwards with my writing the more I feel that I've left things incomplete, I wasn't trying to explain things to a beginner, I was going to aim at my own necessities as someone who has been programming for a decade but that still needs to develop major parts of my knowledge in the world of web development.

The first things I started writing about while trying to define web development, at this time one of the many projects I have on my to do list is writing an http server from scratch and reading the entire specification of the http protocol to deepen my knowledge.

The term "transport layer" is one of those things that I heard a lot of times and it fascinated me but I didn't actually have an internalization of what it actually is, you read stuff like TLS which is used to make HTTPS and that was going to be my first step down from the towers of abstraction into the trenches of the lower level computing that make things work.

But as I started writing I kept thinking that this was incomplete and that I needed to give any beginners trying to learn a better chance and try to replicate my path into learning which was a very good one.

When I was in high school I signed myself into an electronics technician course, at the time it was government sponsored and being offered for free here in Brazil, it was one of those things that peeked my curiosity so I decided to take the course.

Doing this gave me a very deep understanding of how computers work because I learned how digital electronic systems work and the purest form of problem solving representation in the world of computing, the translation of thought and abstraction into a physically automated medium of electronics.

An the history of computers helps explain this, God bless Alan Turing, his work was literally creating an electronic system that would automate a problem that he had to do by hand while he was trying to break the german encryption back in world war 2, he designed a system of problem solving and a machine that could work upon that system.

And put more or less abstraction into it that's what programming is about, finding a problem in the world, deconstructing it into it's many individual components and then automating the process of solving this problem.

So after finishing what until an hour ago was chapter 3 and might be moved forwards to make more sense with my current way of developing this book, where I describe and lay out what is web development I was then going to move back into writing about the applications we write to solve these problems.

But this is where that feeling on incompleteness came to me, because to someone reading at that point that was new to programming they still wouldn't have an understanding of what we do and why we do it, so I decided to add 2 more chapters before what would be the chapter 4 about the internet.

And instead focus on going back and explaining the fundamentals of how computers work, but to understand that you need to understand how we solve problems, the framework that makes it possible to solve problems and to create computers.
