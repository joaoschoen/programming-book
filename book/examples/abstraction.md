## Abstraction

[Return to the book](../content.md#learning-points)

For beginners one way of understanding abstraction is this:

Think about a library.

A library is a place where books are stored, so the library itself is a concept that requires other concepts lower level concepts for it to exist. 

A book is a collection of pages containing information written in ink. 

A page is a sheet made of paper.

Ink is a liquid with color that is used to write information.

The higher in complexity you go the more abstract things become and more knowledge is required to understand them.

If your goal is to get a surface level understanding of the concept being mentioned you can just read the introduction of the articles so you can keep on reading going, that's fine, but I highly recommend that you go further and deepen your knowledge of the subjects.
