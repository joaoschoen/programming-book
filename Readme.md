# A book about Web Development

This repository is an ongoing research project of mine that ended up growing big enough that I decided to transform into a book.

It started with me going on a job search and taking notes on a spreadsheet of what technologies the job postings were asking for, then that got into me writing a script to scrape that data automatically and while trying to organize the data it spiraled into me writing and reading a ton of stuff
