# A book about Computer Science, programming and web development

## Who am I

Hello, my name is Jo√£o but my nickname online is Hordian so you can call me that instead if it's easier to pronounce, I've been programming since 2015 and have entered the world of Web Development in 2020, I've been streaming the process of writing this book on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hordian)

## What is this

This is a guidebook about programming, it's going to cover all the knowledge that I have on the field and try to give you a good path to getting into programming even if you don't understand how a computer works. 

## How I started writing it

It started writing it kind of by accident, I was doing a job search and taking notes on a spreadsheet of what technologies the job postings were asking for.

Then that got into me writing a script to scrape that data automatically, I started trying to organize and categorize that data and while doing so it spiraled into me writing and reading a ton of stuff.

So I decided to turn this whole thing into a book to both document my process of learning, deepen my knowledge while doing so, and help people who are starting to do their own learning.

Due to the way I'm writing this book I might change stuff drastically and reorder entire chapters at this early stage, I've actually started writing a [diary](./diary.md) to document all of the changes that occur during the writing and my thoughts on why I'm doing them.

## Repository structure

I have set up link between the files that contain the content of this book, you can click the links to navigate around.

Each file also contains a link to going back to the previous file 

And they will also contain links to help navigation such as going back to the top of the current file and navigating between topics (WORK IN PROGRESS)
