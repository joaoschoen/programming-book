## Introduction

This is a study on the structure of web development and it's many moving parts. The goal here is producing a comprehensive and holistic guide on what to study.

I'd first like to set up the game plan on how this study will be structured, I'm going to follow an inside out approach on how to the topics, going from the innermost most simple components and building out to the things that surround it.

I'll try my best to be as much of a generalist as possible, however do note that I have a huge bias towards web development as it is my specialization.

## Methodology

I admit my humbleness in and the power of the giants that came before me, as such during this research I won't be explaining things in depth that I don't feel qualified to explain or that aren't my own insights.

If and when at any point I link an article anywhere I will also assume you understand what that is or that you can do a bit of surface level research on your own, after all I can't do your studying for you.

There are loads of words that we read in tech that we don't bother really understanding what they are, I'll try to provide sources on things I learned from the articles I cite.
#### Learning points

Within this document I'll define what are called Learning Points, these will tangential points of information gathered from external sources that are important to read for the understanding of the context, I will be providing reading times for articles and watch time for videos and etc... 

I will note if and ever I skipped something I considered irrelevant inside of the article, while I'll be reading/watching the entirety of them bare the skipped bits. 

if your goal is to get a surface level understanding of the thing I'm mentioning you can just read the introduction of the articles so you can keep on reading this that's fine, but I highly recommend that you go further and deepen your knowledge of the subjects.
#### Preface for beginners

I should note here as a warning that this is not an article written for anyone who is illiterate in the basics of how to write a simple web application, my intent here is to structure and deepen the fundamentals.

As such I highly recommend that if you don't have any of this base knowledge that you follow these two learning points.

But before you do that there is a reassurance that I want to give to you, please don't be alarmed or stress yourself over not understanding the meaning of the terms that you read or hear while doing the basic learning.

You do not need to understand everything all at once that is going on, it is part of the process of learning to not understand things, if this still bothers you go on Wikipedia for any term that you don't understand and read **only** the first two paragraphs about it, this will give enough information for now.

And as a pro tip: note down every new term that you don't understand, over time this will help you measure how much you know and how much you don't know

# Defining the parts of what is Web Development

The first thing that I will do in this journey is try to provide a definition of how we divide the many technologies we use in the web development world, I'll use many sources to try to come up with good definitions of how to explain how we define these categories.

The field of Software as a whole is a huge mess of things, it's a yarn ball that grows over time, has decades of knowledge, and that no mater how much string you pull out of it while studying it there never will come a point where you'll learn faster then the yarn ball grows, there's always more to learn.

So it takes a lot of knowledge to be able to start to process what the hell is going on and try to organize things.

I will use multiple points of view to define software and it's technologies, and since our focus is in

One good starting point

## The layers of communication systems

Web developed  complete my starting point for this research will be defining what systems are and how they communicate, considering we're talking about web development I'll start by the most basic level and define first how the **internet** works.

This is the definition of how computer systems communicate, it divides it into these layers:

Innermost (physical) ⬇
1. Physical layer
2. Data link layer
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer
Outermost (digital) ⬆

This is an inside out visualization of how the communication between computers work, so now you know where these names come from when I and any further learning point references these layers.

It is interesting to note that most of the work that is done in web development happens between the Session and Application layers while the Transport layer and all layers below are given to us for free



#### Learning Point:

In this sense HTTP server is an application layer protocol that communicates

TCP
UDP
TLS
RPC



HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP
